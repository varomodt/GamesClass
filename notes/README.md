The lecture notes and slides will show up here as they are
finished -- the first several lectures are based mostly on
the course notes from Jing Li and Melissa Gymrek.

The tentative outline for this course is the following set of
lectures:

 + Game Representation/Trees with basic Negamax

 + Classical Combinatorial Game Theory (Nim, Hex, etc.)

 + Algebraic Structures in Games (Rubik's cubes)

 + Algorithms: Dynamic programming and Optimal play

 + Computational Complexity of Games (Erik)

 + AI Search techniques (Chess, Go)

 + Other metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithms, Weighting)

 + Economic Game Theory (Markets, Equilibria)

 + Auctions and Mechanism Design

 + Randomized Games (Monopoly, Poker)

 + Inference and Network Models (Reinforcement-Learned Games)

 + Generative games (Cellular Automata Models, Generative Grammars)

 + Game Design Strategies (Feedback/control)

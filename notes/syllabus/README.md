MIT ES.S20 Course Syllabus
-------

# Course Description

This course will examine the mathematical structure and strategy for
many common games and puzzles, culminating in a project exploring an
existing game, an open problem, or a new game design. Using games as
a model, we will explore the fundamental ideas behind AI, groups,
game theory, computational complexity, probability, and cellular
automata. Each class session will involve a discussion of a new kind
of game or design and game play.

This course will be run by Robert Sloan (rsloan) and Jayson Lynch
(jaysonl). Our faculty supervisor is Erik Demaine (edemaine).

# Objectives

Students will learn how to conceptualize and work with games from a
mathematical and computational perspective. We will try to play everything
we talk about during class, but many of them are difficult (like Monopoly);
so some of it will be online.

# Materials

There is no official textbook other than the course notes, but you can use
the resources provided on our GitHub repository. You may also find the
following books useful:

 + Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays by Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy
 + Games, Puzzles, and Computation by Hearn and Demaine

# Grading and Expectations

The course is pass/fail, with the grade breakdown as follows:

|-----------------------|-----|
| Attendance            | 30% |
| Project idea/proposal | 10% |
| Project completion    | 60% |

We would like consistent attendance; but tell us if something happens.

# Weekly Schedule

# Final Project Guidelines

You can work on any of these projects in groups of 1-3 students:
just try to make sure that the work is divided evenly.

## Project Examples

+ Research paper on a game

> Pick a game that we did not discuss deeply in class and use it to
> explore new mathematical or computational strategies. Be sure to
> include all relevant background information in a final paper which
> should be at least 13 pages.

+ Coding project

> Implement a game we've discussed and/or an AI Engine in a language
> that the course staff understands as an application. Your code should
> be documented enough to be comprehensible, especially if you implement
> your own algorithms.

+ Create a toy or game

> This could be a physical toy, a board game, a card game or whatever
> you happen to come up with. You should provide a short write-up with
> designs to describe the ideas behind what you made (along with the
> rules...)

+ Open Problems

> Work on an open problem in recreational mathematics, which are plentiful
> especially with less common games. This should look something like the
> research paper, though probably shorter depending on the conceptual
> complexity of what you're talking about. Make sure to describe the
> problem, what you'd like to find out, and its significance.

## Deadlines

1. Project idea by 3/13

> We approve your project idea -- this can be done via email.

2. Project proposal by 4/10

> A formal project proposal detailing everything you plan to
> do with deadlines. If you have a group project, you should
> have delegated general tasks.

3. Project final by 5/8

> We will present projects during the last days of classes.
